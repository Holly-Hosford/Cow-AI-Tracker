# Cow-AI-Tracker
This python programme allows you to track the cow AI statements after they are entered. 
This programme can enter the statement (date and bull number), add any additional information, 
get a rough indication of when the cow will calve, edit and remove any statements which have been 
entered incorrectly and find the cows with a bull number in common.
Two .txt files need to created and replace in the code, to keep track of the statements after each use and for future reference. Otherwise two .txt files are included, practice.txt and cow_ai_info2.0.txt which are already set up in the code.Once these two .txt files are downloaded along with the main program, the program should work.
Please enter the statements in order of date as currently otherwise you may not get an accurate estimated date for the cow calving
